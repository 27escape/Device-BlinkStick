# Device-BlinkStick

Control a BlinkStick (http://blinkstick.com/).

Aims to provide the similar functions as the python implementation, 
but obviously in perl! 

The command line script is called 'stick', rather than blinkstick, so that you can 
have both installed on your system, as this perl version currently does not have
all the features of the python command line script.
